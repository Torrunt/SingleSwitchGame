SingleSwitchGame
================

A University project based on the idea of a game that uses a single switch and has dynamically adjusting difficulty.  Requiring only a single switch to play the game allows people with severe movement restrictions to be able to play as well. Having the game's difficulty dynamically adjust based on the player's performance will also allow people of varying abilities and skill to get some sort of challenge.
